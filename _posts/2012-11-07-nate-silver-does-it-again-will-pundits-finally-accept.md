My favorite statistician did it again! Just like in 2008, he predicted the presidential election results almost perfectly. For those that don&#8217;t know, Nate Silver is the statistician that runs the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight blog</a>. He combines data from hundreds of polls, uses historical data to weigh them appropriately and then uses a statistical model to run simulations and predict outcomes.

While the pundits were claiming the race was a &#8220;dead heat&#8221;, the day before the election Nate gave Obama a 90% chance of winning. Several pundits attacked Nate (some attacks were personal) for his predictions and demonstrated their ignorance of Statistics. Jeff wrote a <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/post/34635539704/on-weather-forecasts-nate-silver-and-the" target="_blank">nice post on this</a>. The plot below demonstrates how great Nate&#8217;s prediction was. Note that each of the 45 states (including DC) for which he predicted a 90% probability or higher of winning for candidate A, candidate A won. For the other 6 states the range of percentages was 48-52%. If Florida goes for Obama he will have predicted every single state correctly.

**Update****: **Congratulations also to Sam Wang (<a href="http://election.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton Election Consortium</a>) and Simon Jackman (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/simon-jackman/pollster-predictions_b_2081013.html" target="_blank">pollster</a>) that also called the election perfectly. And thanks to the pollsters that provided the unbiased (on average) data used by all these folks. Data analysts won &#8220;experts&#8221; lost.

~~**Update 2**: New plot with data from <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/elections/2012-election-results/" target="_blank">here</a>. Old graph <a href="http://rafalab.jhsph.edu/simplystats/silver.png" target="_blank">here</a>.~~
