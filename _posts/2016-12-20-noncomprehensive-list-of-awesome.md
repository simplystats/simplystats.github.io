_Editor's note: For the last few years I have made a list of awesome things that other people did ([2015](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/12/21/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2015/), [2014](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/12/17/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2014/), [2013](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/20/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-this-year/)). Like in previous years I'm making a list, again right off the top of my head.  If you know of some, you should make your own list or add it to the comments! I have also avoided talking about stuff I worked on or that people here at Hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other peopleâ€™s awesome stuff. I write this post because a blog often feels like a place to complain, but we started Simply Stats as a place to be pumped up about the stuff people were doing with data._


* Thomas Lin Pedersen created the [tweenr](https://github.com/thomasp85/tweenr) package for interpolating graphs in animations. Check out this awesome [logo](https://twitter.com/thomasp85/status/809896220906897408) he made with it. 
* Yihui Xie is still blowing away everything he does. First it was [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and then the yolo feature in [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan) package. 
* J Alammar built this great [visual introduction to neural networks](https://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/)
* Jenny Bryan is working literal world wonders with legos to teach functional programming. I loved her [Data Rectangling](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/data-rectangling) talk. The analogy between exponential families and data frames is so so good. 
* Hadley Wickham's book on [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is everything you'd expect. Super clear, great examples, just a really nice book. 
* David Robinson is a machine put on this earth to create awesome data science stuff. Here is [analyzing Trump's tweets](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) and here he is on [empirical Bayes modeling explained with baseball](http://varianceexplained.org/r/hierarchical_bayes_baseball/).
* Julia Silge and David created the [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html) package. This is a holy moly big contribution to NLP in R. They also have a killer [book on tidy text mining](http://tidytextmining.com/).
* Julia used the package to do this [fascinating post](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Reddit-Responds/) on mining Reddit after the election. 
* It would be hard to pick just five different major contributions from JJ Allaire (great interview [here](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2016/10/12/interview-with-j-j-allaire/)), Joe Cheng, and the rest of the Rstudio folks. Rstudio is absolutely _churning_ out awesome stuff at a rate that is hard to keep up with. I loved [R notebooks](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/10/05/r-notebooks/) and have used them extensively for teaching. 
* Konrad Kording and Brett Mensh full on mike dropped on how to write a paper with their [10 simple rules piece](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/28/088278) Figure 1 from that paper should be affixed to the office of every student/faculty in the world permanently. 
* Yaniv Erlich just can't stop himself from doing interesting things like [seeq.io](https://seeq.io/) and [dna.land](https://dna.land/). 
* Thomaz Berisa and Joe Pickrell set up a freaking [Python API for genomics projects](https://medium.com/the-seeq-blog/start-a-human-genomics-project-with-a-few-lines-of-code-dde90c4ef68#.g64meyjim).
* DataCamp continues to do great things. I love their [DataChats](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/an-interview-with-david-robinson-data-scientist-at-stack-overflow) series and they have been rolling out tons of new courses. 
* Sean Rife and Michele Nuijten created [statcheck.io](http://statcheck.io/) for checking papers for p-value calculation errors. This was all over the press, but I just like the site as a dummy proofing for myself. 
* This was the artificial intelligence [tweet of the year](https://twitter.com/notajf/status/795717253505413122)
* I loved seeing PLoS Genetics start a policy of looking for papers in [biorxiv](http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2016/10/the-best-of-both-worlds-preprints-and-journals/). 
* Matthew Stephens [post](https://medium.com/@biostatistics/guest-post-matthew-stephens-on-biostatistics-pre-review-and-reproducibility-a14a26d83d6f#.usisi7kd3) on his preprint getting pre-accepted and reproducibility is also awesome. Preprints are so hot right now!
* Lorena Barba made this amazing [reproducibility syllabus](https://hackernoon.com/barba-group-reproducibility-syllabus-e3757ee635cf#.2orb46seg) then [won the Leamer-Rosenthal prize](https://twitter.com/LorenaABarba/status/809641955437051904) in open science.
* Colin Dewey continues to do just stellar stellar work, this time on [re-annotating genomics samples](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/11/30/090506). This is one of the key open problems in genomics. 
* I love FlowingData sooooo much. Here is one on [the changing American diet](http://flowingdata.com/2016/05/17/the-changing-american-diet/).
* If you like computational biology and data science and like _super_ detailed reports of meetings/talks you [MIchael Hoffman](https://twitter.com/michaelhoffman) is your man. How he actually summarizes that much information in real time is still beyond me. 
* I really really wish I had been at Alyssa Frazee's talk at startup.ml but loved this [review of it](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/09/adversarial-machine-learning/). Sampling, inverse probability weighting? Love that stats flavor!
* I have followed Cathy O'Neil for a long time in her persona as [mathbabedotorg](https://twitter.com/mathbabedotorg) so it is no surprise to me that her new book [Weapons of Math Descruction](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B019B6VCLO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is so good. One of the best works on the ethics of data out there. 
* A related and very important piece is on [Machine bias in sentencing](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) by Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu and Lauren Kirchner at ProPublica.
* Dimitris Rizopolous created this stellar [integrated Shiny app](http://iprogn.blogspot.com/2016/03/an-integrated-shiny-app-for-course-on.html) for his repeated measures class. I wish I could build things half this nice. 
* Daniel Engber's piece on [Who will debunk the debunkers?](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-debunk-the-debunkers/) at fivethirtyeight just keeps getting more relevant. 
* I rarely am willing to watch a talk posted on the internet, but [Amelia McNamara's talk on seeing nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hps9r7JZQP8) was an exception. Plus she talks so fast #jealous. 
* Sherri Rose's post on [economic diversity in the academy](http://drsherrirose.com/economic-diversity-and-the-academy-statistical-science) focuses on statistics but should be required reading for anyone thinking about diversity. Everything about it is impressive. 
* If you like your data science with a side of Python you should definitely be checking out Jake Vanderplas's [data science handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do) and the associated [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook).
* I love Thomas Lumley [being snarky](http://www.statschat.org.nz/2016/12/19/sauna-and-dementia/) about the stats news. Its a guilty pleasure. If he ever collected them into a book I'd buy it (hint Thomas :)). 
* Dorothy Bishop's blog is one of the ones I read super regularly. Her post on [When is a replication a replication](http://deevybee.blogspot.com/2016/12/when-is-replication-not-replication.html) is just one example of her very clearly explaining a complicated topic in a sensible way. I find that so hard to do and she does it so well. 
* Ben Goldacre's crowd is doing a bunch of interesting things. I really like their [OpenPrescribing](https://openprescribing.net/) project. 
* I'm really excited to see what Elizabeth Rhodes does with the experimental design for the [Ycombinator Basic Income Experiment](http://blog.ycombinator.com/moving-forward-on-basic-income/). 
* Lucy D'Agostino McGowan made this [amazing explanation](http://www.lucymcgowan.com/hill-for-data-scientists.html) of Hill's criterion using xckd. 
* It is hard to overstate how good Leslie McClure's blog is. This post on [biostatistics is public health](https://statgirlblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/16/biostatistics-is-public-health/) should be read aloud at every SPH in the US. 
* The ASA's [statement on p-values](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108) is a really nice summary of all the issues around a surprisngly controversial topic. Ron Wasserstein and Nicole Lazar did a great job putting it together.
* I really liked [this piece](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleId=2513561&guestAccessKey=4023ce75-d0fb-44de-bb6c-8a10a30a6173) on the relationship between income and life expectancy by Raj Chetty and company.
* Christie Aschwanden continues to be the voice of reason on the [statistical crises in science](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/failure-is-moving-science-forward/).

That's all I have for now, I know I'm missing things. Maybe my New Year's resolution will be to keep better track of the awesome things other people are doing :).
